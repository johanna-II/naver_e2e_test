# 🚀 Naver E2E Test Extravaganza! 🎭

Welcome to the most exciting end-to-end testing project this side of the internet! Buckle up, because we're about to take Naver.com for a wild ride! 🎢

## 🌟 What's This All About?

This project is your ticket to ensuring Naver.com's registration and login processes are smoother than a freshly waxed bobsled track. We've got:

- ✅ End-to-end tests that'll make your QA team jump for joy
- 🐳 A Dockerized setup that's cooler than a penguin's igloo
- 🧹 Pylint integration to keep your code cleaner than a neat freak's kitchen

## 🛠 Prerequisites

- Docker (If you don't have it, are you even a developer? Just kidding! 😉)
- A sense of humor (very important for dealing with unexpected test failures)

## 🏃‍♂️ How to Run This Baby

1. Clone this repo faster than you can say "Selenium":
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/naver-e2e-test.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project folder:
   ```
   cd naver-e2e-test
   ```

3. Fire up those engines:
   ```
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

4. Sit back, relax, and watch the magic happen! ✨

## 📊 What You'll Get

After running the tests, you'll be the proud owner of:

- `report.html`: A beautiful test report that's more detailed than your grandma's lasagna recipe.
- `pylint_report.txt`: A list of code style suggestions. Think of it as your code's personal fashion consultant.
